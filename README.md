# jasmine-testing
- Learning TDD with Jasmine. 
- Testing the famous FizzBuzz problem

## Test Cases
- 1 should print 1
- 2 should print 2
- 3 should print Fizz
- 5 should print Buzz
- 15 should print FizzBuzz


## Three Laws of TDD
- First law: You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

- Second law: You may not write more of a failing test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

- Third law: You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.
